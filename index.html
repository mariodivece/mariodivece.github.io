            I am a Mexican Entrepreneur and Electrical Engineer. I graduated from the
            <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca" target="_blank">University of Alberta</a> in
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006" target="_blank">2006</a>. I have worked for almost 20 years in the
            development of software, artificial intelligence projects, computer vision, multimedia, automation, and
            embedded systems. I have extensive experience in the real estate, petroleum,
            automotive, financial services, and health services industries in domestic and foreign markets.

            In the middle of the recession of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009" target="_blank">2009</a>, and together
            with my business partner Mike Barrett, I started my first company in a small office with only 3 employees.
            <a href="https://www.unosquare.com" target="_blank">Unosquare</a> is a company specializing in software engineering
            services. Today (2018) it has over 400 employees with offices in Mexico, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

        <p>
            I am also the co-founder of <a href="https://www.aspiria.mx" target="_blank">Aspiria</a>, which I started in
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014" target="_blank">2014</a> with my high school friend Guillermo Hernandez.
            Aspiria specializes in providing financing to small and medium businesses in Mexico. The company continues to attract
            national and foreign capital to expand its portfolio, and in less than 3 years has been able to grant close to 1000 loans.

            My main goal and mission in life focuses on the development and enlargement of the middle class. I will continue to
            create and grow businesses that encourage and facilitate professional, economic, and social development for all my employees
            and their families.
